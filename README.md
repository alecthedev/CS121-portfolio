CS121 Portfolio: A Collection of Activities and Labs
---
This is not every assignment we had, just some that I thought were neat. 

You will find each package within the src folder. 

- ClassActivity29: Data Structures
- ClassActivity31: Sorting Algorithms
- Lab12: Similar to [project3](https://github.com/alecthedev/project3), student record using hashmaps
- Lab13: Greatest Common Divisor Calculator
- ShuffleTest: Durstenfeld shuffle, not an assignment. I made this after reading about shuffling [on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%E2%80%93Yates_shuffle#The_modern_algorithm).
- XML_Activity: XML Parser in Java
